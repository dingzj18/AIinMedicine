# AI in Medicine
This repository introduces Applied Machine Learning Techniques and Topics in Medicine or Medical Engineering

## Introduction

This repository will contain three directories, including 'data', 'code' and 'doc'. In data, we can find some popular data, such as X ray, CT, ECG, RNA-seq, etc; in code, we put the codes in jupyter notebooks, in order to describe some classic applications of machine learning, especially deep learning.

## Who reads this repository

Undergraduates, graduates in their first one or two years, can read the documents and run the codes.

## How to read

I will update all documents by applying [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/zh-cn/).

Currently people can also read the codes in jupyter notebooks in code, and read the markdowns in doc.
